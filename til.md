09-29-21: I learned that I need to spend more time every day practicing code
09-30-21: learned to install python, create and execute a python script and jupyter notebook.  intall a library using pip. use the -i flag with python/ipython to to run a script interactively.  started to understand the utility of jupyter
10-01-21: introductory python.  data types. lists. list comprehension, although i didn't really understand it. yet. learned about lists vs sets vs tuples vs dictionaries and how to create an empty one of each -- see the corey schafer video at https://youtu.be/W8KRzm-HUcc
10-04-21: python control structures and practice.  for loops. while and break/continue.  still not getting this 100%, plenty of practice to do.
10-05-21: learned functions. part of the exercise really required an understanding of lists and loops, which was great
10-07-21: first lesson on imports. 
10-08-21: great lesson from Ravinder on matplotlib.  
10-10-21: practiced matplotlib. 
10-12-21: NUMPYYYYY love this. like a walk in the park next to for-loops
10-13-21: reviewed some numpy, AND got some review on for loops and list comprehension, which i needed and still need
10-14-21: finally started Pandas, learned Series. How to plot using pd series. Slicing techniques, which I had seen but not understood well previously. What is a vectorized operation.  Methods vs Attributes and how this affects using the .str in pandas
10-15-21: first lesson on pandasd DataFrames. Please remember to review the Kaggle lesson too, which was excellent
10-17-21: practiced and got better at some python data manipulation exercises
10-18-21: learned advanced dataframes--meaning, SQL and PANDAS together.  Pretty neat.  I'm more excited about starting to get my head around accessing embedded dictionaries and lists.
10-19-21: how to execute a command in SQL from a python/jupyter command line using pandas. review from previous days, actually. excellent practice though. and different ways to slice and dice data. pandas 'pivot_tables' and crosstabs.  
10-21-21: learned the initial Seaborn stuff. Practiced with exercises, it went pretty well as far as i got
10-22-21: more of the same, got more git practice with the guipsamora folder, and more pandas and seaborn practice as well
20-22-21: repeat entry. we learned spreadsheets basics yesterday (in google docs, all of it)
10-24-21: learned iferror() in spreadsheets. and correct way to use vlookup() across sheets
10-25-21: basics of data visualization.  the 7 step review process. good and bad charts
10-26-21: story telling
10-27-21: tableau! import data from different sources. initial manipulation, graphics, etc
10-29-21: learned some basic functions of sketchpad, including using layers to manipulate images
10-31-21: how to record a screen share for presentation
11-01-21: intro to scipy library.  
11-02-21: stats module.  Discrete vs Continuous data. pdf/pmf; cdf/ppf; sf/isf. Apply each to different types of data
11-03-21: probability distributions and graphing them. creating simulations
11-04-21: how to calculate t-statistic, p-value.  what is null hypothesis and alternate hypothesis.  how to decide whether or not to reject the hypothesis.
11-05-21: pearsons test.  correlation.  spent an awful lot of time reviewing data manipulation in order to be able to run the tests
11-08-21: chi ** 2 test. refresh sql and python a little. numpy too a little.  pandas always
11-09-21: data acquisition; caching--built a function to pull data from file or sql depending on if the file is present.  initial classification exercises
11-10-21: data prep lesson. built functions to perform certain cleaning and splitting processes. also worked with the acquire functions more, which i had built previously
11-15-21: tidy data. melting and pivoting-->wide format data vs long format. see article too
11-16-21: model evaluation: accuracy, recall, precision (and specificity/npv)
11-17-21: sklearn's decision tree formulae.  also, installed graphviz and used it to visualize the decision tree
11-18-21: random forest model.  
11-19-21: KNN and Logistec Regression models.

12-02-21: Scaling
12-04-21: created explore graphing functions
12-06-21: learned the OLS (ordinary least squares) regression model and when it is not a good predictor (think heteroscedascticity). The graphs can differ widely depending on the x variable you're looking at, depending on how good each respective one is for the model.
12-07-21: K-Best and Recursive Feature Engineering functions of sklearn. Loved this.  
12-08-21: Finally applied different regression models and compared.
